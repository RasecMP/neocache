# NEOCACHE

This repository intends to provide anyone with a raspberry pi pico w to create a simple digital geocache.

Geocaching is a worldwide game. For more information visit: https://www.geocaching.com

# Installation and setup

To install it simply upload all the files to the raspberry pi pico w. Then Phew library must be installed: it can be downloaded from this website: https://pypi.org/project/micropython-phew/ or directly from the plug-in manager in Thonny.

To activate it run main.py or simply connect the pico w to a power sorce.

# How to use it

To log your visit simply connect to the wifi network (default SSID is GEOCACHING and PW is 12345678) and then access 192.168.4.1 website on a browser.
 
# Final thoughts

I think neocache fits more in the mystery cache type, but its kind of a traditional cache. Its a digital container with a digital logbook!

Hope this inspires someone. Everything needed is a raspberry pico w and a power bank (or some sort of power sorce).
