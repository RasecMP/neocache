# NEOCACHE

This repository intends to provide anyone with a raspberry pi pico w to create a simple digital geocache.

To install it simply upload all the files to the raspberry pi pico w. Phew library must be installed.

To use it simply connect to the wifi network (default SSID is GEOCACHING and PW is 12345678) and then access 192.168.4.1 website (QR codes can be usefull).
  
I think neocache fits more in the mystery cache type, but its kind of a traditional cache. Its a digital container with a digital logbook!

Hope this inspires someone. All needed is a raspberry pico w and a power bank (or some sort of power sorce).
